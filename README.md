This extension adds a button to the top right bar (next to chat & participant list) to enable you to see everyone in Google Meet. Squared gives every participant an equal sized video for use in meetings without a primary speaker (such as working from home silent meetings).

This extension forcibly loads every participant's video when Squared is enabled and may cause performance issues in extremely large meetings.

Includes a variety of options to enhance your meeting: include your own video, highlight who is speaking, and hide participants without video!
